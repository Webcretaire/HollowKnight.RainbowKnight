# RainbowKnight

*[Preview of the effects implemented so far (keyboard view only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNZI_AMrrO0)*

This Hollow Knight mod adds support for Razer Chroma devices, by allowing RGB lighting to react to a variety of in-game events, such as as casting a spell, getting hit, benching, (crystal-)dashing, etc.

So far it supports keyboards, mice and Chroma-link devices. This last device type corresponds to non-Razer peripherals that still support Razer Chroma. For example these include MSI Mystic Light devices (for them Razer integration must be enabled in Dragon Center).
